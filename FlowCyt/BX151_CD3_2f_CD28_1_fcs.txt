BX151_CD3_2f_CD28_1_fcs	
BX151_CD3_2f_CD28_2_fcs	

The objective is to find the relative frequency of the following
1. viable CD3+CD4+ that have undergone 0, 1, 2, ... divisions
2. viable CD3+CD8+ that have undergone 0, 1, 2, ... divisions

Useful for nested DP algorithm as there is a definite cluster with
sub-clusters structure in the data, and it is a relatively smalll data
set.

Also useful for information metric to see which markers are not needed
- eyeballing suggests that CD3 contributes little if anything to the
definition of the subsets of interest, even though this is so
fundamental to immunology (it is the T cell receptor) that it is
always included in such panels. If true, this is very useful since
many flow cytometers have only 3 or 4 fluorescent channel, and being
able to replace CD3 with another more informative marker would be a
big deal.
